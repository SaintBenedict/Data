        <label>total authority</label>
        <description>None could possibly think I have anything in common with the lower ranks here. All acknowledge my stature. It is fulfilling.</description>

      <li>
        <label>strong authority</label>
        <description>I'm well-separated from the common folk. It's good to reign so thoroughly.</description>

      <li>
        <label>uncertain authority</label>
        <description>My position feels like it's not properly acknowledged. I need to reign and establish my stature over the low people.</description>

      <li>
        <label>weak authority</label>
        <description>I've had almost no opportunity to reign recently. One would barely even know I'm not a commoner. It's a serious problem.</description>

      <li>
        <label>no authority</label>
        <description>My stature has been totally ignored! I'm forced to act as a commoner day in and day out. This is an outrage!</description>
