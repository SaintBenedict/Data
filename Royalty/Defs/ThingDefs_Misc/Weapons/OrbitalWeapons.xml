    <label>orbital mech cluster targeter</label>
    <description>An ancient military targeting device. It signals an orbital platform to drop a mechanoid combat cluster at the targeted point. The cluster may include any mixture of mechanoids and mech defense structures.
\nThough they may have once had some allegiance to the ancient army that created this unit, any mechs dropped now will indiscriminately attack any human they see - including the one that summoned them.
\nThe unit only contains one usage code, so it can only be used once.</description>
