  <RoyalFavorTip>You can choose one of your {0} to receive {1} {2} from {3_name}.\n\nBy receiving {2}, you gain royal titles. The higher the title, the more privileges you get, like trading with imperial settlements, requesting royal aid, or using powerful, exotic weapons. But beware, {0} with royal titles will be unhappy if you don't dress them properly or fulfill their bedroom requirements.</RoyalFavorTip>
