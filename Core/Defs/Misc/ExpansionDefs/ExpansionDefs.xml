    <description>The Empire has arrived. Their honor-bound culture wields hyper-advanced technology, while bowing to the ancient traditions of kings, queens, titles and honor.

Earn royal titles. Construct luxurious thronerooms and royal chambers. Call Imperial elite troops and bond with unique Imperial bladelink weapons.

Use new psychic abilities. Blind, mind-control, nauseate, and induce insanity. Teleport, block pain, confer deadly focus, and turn invisible.

Serve the Imperial High Stellarch well and earn a pass off the rimworld.

A new quest system procedurally generates unique quests, combining different goals, foes, guests, rewards, helpers, special threats, and world conditions. The expansion adds a large amount of new quest content.

Mechanoids can now create clusters of mechanoid buildings. Each mech cluster generates with a unique layout, presenting a unique tactical puzzle. Mech clusters always appear in an initially dormant state, so you can plan and execute a careful attack - or use them against your foes.

You don't have to serve the Empire. You can steal psychic amplifiers and other Imperial technology. The rebel life is free - but challenging.

This expansion includes a new album music by Alistair Lindsay, composer of the original RimWorld soundtrack.</description>
