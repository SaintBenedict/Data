      <!-- Interface -->
      <li>You can dismiss letters by right-clicking on them.</li>
      <li>You can hold the shift key to queue orders on your colonists.</li>
      <li>You can right-click and drag to reorder colonists on the colonist bar.</li>
      <li>You can select previous/next colonist with the , and . keys.</li>
      <li>Many menus allow you to click and drag a setting to 'paint' it over many entries. This even works for things like outfits or food restrictions.</li>
      <li>In the work tab's manual priorities mode, 1 is first priority, while 4 is last priority.</li>
      <li>Each colonists' mood is displayed in the background of their icon in the colonist bar at the top of the screen.</li>
      <li>Shift-clicking the name of a work type in the Work tab changes settings for all colonists at once.</li>
      <li>Right-clicking a number in the Work tab using manual priorities will reduce the priority instead of increasing it.</li>

      <!-- Combat -->
      <li>In a gunfight, always be behind cover!</li>
      <li>In a gunfight, spread your colonists out! Bunched-up targets are easy to hit.</li>
      <li>Smoke totally prevents turrets from detecting targets, but people can still shoot with reduced accuracy.</li>
      <li>When designing defences, assume enemies will get inside using drop pods or tunnels. Build internal defensive positions.</li>
      <li>Foggy or rainy weather reduces the accuracy of ranged weapons.</li>
      <li>You can analyze the chance a shot will hit by selecting the shooter and placing the mouse over the target.</li>
      <li>Turrets explode when they take a lot of damage. Don't put them too close together, and don't put your people too close to them.</li>
      <li>Some animals explode upon death. You can use transport pods to drop animals on enemies. Think about it.</li>
      <li>If you need help in a fight, call your allies using the comms console.</li>
      <li>Maddened animals will attack any human, including your enemies. You can use this.</li>
      <li>EMP bursts will temporarily disable turrets, mortar shields, and bullet shields.</li>
      <li>EMP bursts instantly break personal shields.</li>

      <!-- Hunting -->
      <li>The hunter stealth stat reduces the chance of animal attacks. It is affected by the hunter's animals and shooting skills.</li>
      <li>Animals are more likely to attack when harmed from close range. Long-range, slow-firing weapons are safest for hunting.</li>
      <li>Entire herds of animals may attack you when you try to hunt them. Accept the risk before hunting, or choose weaker prey.</li>
      <li>If you hunt boomrats and boomalopes when it's raining, their deaths won't cause forest fires.</li>

      <!-- Caravans -->
      <li>Place a caravan packing spot to designate where you want your caravans to form up.</li>
      <li>Single-person caravans can be very useful in certain situations.</li>
      <li>Faster animals make faster caravans.</li>
      <li>Smaller caravans will be attacked less often because they're less visible.</li>
      <li>Before forming a caravan, collect them items you want to send in a stockpile near your caravan packing spot. This will make packing much faster.</li>
      <li>If you have untrained animals in your caravan, you can split them into a separate caravan before attacking an enemy, to keep them out of the fight.</li>

      <!-- Game style -->
      <li>RimWorld is a story generator, not a skill test. A ruined colony is a dramatic tragedy, not a failure.</li>
      <li>Some colonists are worse than useless. Bad allies are part of the challenge.</li>
      <li>If you can't defend against a threat, make a caravan and run. You may lose your home, but your story can continue.</li>

      <!-- Building -->
      <li>Avoid using stone for doors. They open very slowly, which wastes your colonists' time.</li>
      <li>Put chairs in front of workbenches so workers can sit comfortably while working.</li>
      <li>Mechanical structures break down and require replacement components. Don't build things you don't need.</li>
      <li>Be careful what you construct on bridges. Bridges collapse easily under explosions, and your buildings will go with them.</li>
      <li>Clean rooms increase research speed, improve medical outcomes, and reduce food poisoning. Sterile tiles make rooms extra-clean.</li>
      <li>Building your whole colony in one structure saves resources, but also makes it difficult to contain fires.</li>
      <li>Terrain affects movement speed. Build floors to help your colonists get around quicker.</li>
      <li>Different terrain has different inherent cleanliness levels. Tiles are inherently clean; dirt is inherently dirty.</li>

      <!-- Diplomacy -->
      <li>You can give prisoners as gifts. Giving a prisoner back to his own faction will be highly appreciated.</li>
      <li>You can request specific types of trade caravans using the comms console.</li>
      <li>You can use transport pods to send gifts directly to other factions' bases - even your enemies. This improves faction relations.</li>

      <!-- Misc -->
      <li>Keeping prisoners together saves space. However, prisoners kept together will try to break out together.</li>
      <li>Enemy faction bases are very well-defended. You don't need to attack them - but be well-prepared if you choose to try.</li>
      <li>Cute tame animals will nuzzle your colonists, improving their mood.</li>
      <li>Assign your herbivorous animals to areas with lots of grass. They'll eat the grass and spare you the need to feed them.</li>
      <li>If someone has a serious infection in a limb, you can remove the limb to save their life.</li>
      <li>Sloshing through water makes people unhappy. Build a bridge when you can.</li>
      <li>Luciferium can heal scars - even those on the eye or brain. It is, however, a permanent commitment.</li>
      <li>Work and movement speed are affected by lighting. Everything is slower in the dark.</li>
      <li>Deep underground caverns have a naturally stable temperature, even if it's very hot or cold outside.</li>
      <li>Mountain bases are easy to defend. The downside is that people go crazy spending too long underground. And giant insects.</li>
      <li>Prisoners will join much quicker and attempt fewer breakouts when they're in a good mood.</li>
      <li>You can have multiple researchers working simultaneously at multiple research tables.</li>
      <li>Geysers heat up rooms if enclosed. This can be dangerous, or useful.</li>
      <li>Explosions extinguish fires in their blast radius. This makes artillery shells useful for stopping fires when there is no other choice.</li>
      <li>Even serious setbacks don't mean the game has to end. Try playing out a lost battle - often the best stories come from the darkest situations.</li>

      <!-- Added misc -->
      <!-- These can't be reordered because it would break translations -->
      <li>Clean labs with sterile tile give research speed bonuses.</li>
      <li>You can change storyteller and difficulty at any time through the options menu.</li>
      <li>The more factions you are allied with, the more random traders and military aid you will receive.</li>
